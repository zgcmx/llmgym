In a 100x100 two-dimensional grid environment, three unknown pollution source locations are randomly generated, where pollutants spread over time.The mode of diffusion is Transient Diffusion. Additionally, five buildings with an area of 3x3 are randomly placed within the grid. The coordinates of these obstacles (buildings) are as follows: [(25, 35, 45, 55), (30, 40, 60, 70), (50, 60, 20, 30), (70, 80, 50, 60), (10, 20, 30, 40)], where each tuple represents the coordinates (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) of a building.The four coordinates are xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, and the drone is not allowed to enter the obstacle box.
In this environment, two drones act as agents to locate the source of pollution by measuring the concentration of pollutants at their current locations. You are tasked with guiding the drones' next movement by comparing the concentration of pollutants at the drones' locations with the highest concentration measured by the drones thus far. The drones have five movement options: move up, move down, move left, move right or stand still, which correspond to the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Please use your best judgment to guide the drones towards the source of the pollution.
Next, I will provide the current locations of Drone1 and Drone2, the concentration of pollution at those locations, the highest concentration detected previously, and the time since that highest concentration, as well as the action taken in the previous step. The format is as follows:
Drone 1: Located at coordinates (20.0, 80.0), with a local pollution concentration of 1.00. Highest concentration detected: 0.00, time steps since highest: 0.0. Last action: move up.
Drone 2: Located at coordinates (80.0, 20.0), with a local pollution concentration of 0.00. Highest concentration detected: 0.00, time steps since highest: 0.0. Last action: move up.
The higher the concentration, the closer to the source of pollution, please direct the drone to explore the relatively high concentration to find the source of pollution.Please instruct the drone not to encounter obstacles
You can guide the next movement of the two drones based on this information. Please remember there are three pollution sources instead of one. Please choose an action for each drone. Type '0' to move up, '1' to move down, '2' to move left, '3' to move right, or '4' to stay in place. Ensure you only provide action numbers from the valid action list.More importantly, the output of your content must be a two-dimensional array. For example, if you want Drone1 to move up and Drone2 to move down, you would output: [0, 1].You may include your thought process, but it is essential to ensure that the format of the very end of the output is:So, the output for the next actions of the drones would be: [action 1, action 2].
